# Natural-Language-Processing-with-Disaster-Tweets

In this exercise I'm going to build a model that predicts which Tweets are about real disasters and which ones are not, using the data from Kaggle competition:

The available data is organized in two files; train and test, with the text of the Tweets and the classification: 1 when it is about a real disaster and 0 when is not.
